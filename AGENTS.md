# Agent Instructions

## Project Context

Skeleton gathering standard components configuration for SvelteKit web application projects.

## Language Policy

- **All project content must be in English**: source code, comments, commit messages, and documentation.
- **Human conversations in OpenCode remain in French**.

## Package Manager Policy

- Always use `pnpm` for installing, adding, and removing packages.
- Never use `npm` or `yarn`.

## Code Quality

This project uses **ESLint** with `eslint-plugin-svelte` for linting and
**Prettier** with `prettier-plugin-svelte` for formatting:

- `pnpm lint` — check for code issues
- `pnpm format` — auto-format code
- `pnpm check` — run both (format check + lint)

Configuration: `eslint.config.js`, `prettier.config.js`

## Database

This project uses **PostgreSQL** as its database, accessed directly with raw SQL — **no ORM**.

SQL queries are executed using the [`postgres`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) library (package name: `postgres`).

Migrations are managed by [`postgres-shift`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres-shift) and located in `sqls/migrations/`.

The complete schema (consolidated) is written by hand in `sqls/schema.sql`.

## Example / Scaffolding Files

The following files are examples meant to be replaced with your actual project code:

- `sqls/migrations/00001_initial/` — example migration (creates a sample `contacts` table)
- `sqls/fixtures/00001_contacts.sql` — example fixture data
- `sqls/schema.sql` — example consolidated schema

These files are marked with comments (`-- Example`) at the top. Replace or remove them as needed.

> **Remove this entire section once the example files have been replaced or deleted.**

## SvelteKit

This project uses **SvelteKit 2** with `@sveltejs/adapter-node` for SSR.

### Container build (multi-stage)

The `Containerfile` uses a two-stage build:

1. **Stage 1 (`build`)** — installs all deps, runs `pnpm build`
2. **Stage 2 (production)** — installs only prod deps, copies `build/`, `src/db.js`, `src/logger.js`, `src/migrate.js`, `src/seed.js`, and `sqls/`

The production image runs `node /app/build/index.js` via the `serve` command in `entrypoint.sh` (which also runs migrations before starting the server).

## Node.js Paradigms

### Code style

- Inline simple logic: prefer inline expressions over extracting helper functions for trivial operations (e.g., single `await sql` calls).
- Extract functions only when code reuse, readability, or testability genuinely benefits.

### Functional style

- Prefer chaining `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.forEach()` over imperative loops.
- Avoid intermediate variables without semantic value (_expression-oriented_):
  prefer `getMonths().map(...)` to `const months = getMonths(); months.map(...)`.
  Prefer `(await Promise.all(...)).forEach(...)` to `const results = []; for (...)`.
  If a step is complex, prefer a comment over a superfluous variable.
- Avoid mutations: no `.push()` in a loop if `.map()` suffices (_immutability_).

### To avoid

- Tacit programming / point-free style: always explicitly name function arguments.
  Prefer `[1,2,3].map(n => add1(n))` to `[1,2,3].map(add1)`.

## OpenAPI Spec Sync

The OpenAPI specification is dynamically generated in
`src/routes/(api)/api/v1/openapi.json/+server.js`.

**Any change to request/response schemas in route handlers must be reflected
here too.** The Scalar API reference UI at `/api/reference` consumes this spec.

## Documentation Maintenance

Remove from this file any section or reference that becomes obsolete after file deletions or structural changes. Keep AGENTS.md up to date.
