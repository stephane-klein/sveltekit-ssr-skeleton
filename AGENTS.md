# Agent Instructions

## Project Context

Skeleton gathering standard components configuration for SvelteKit web application projects.

## Language Policy

- **All project content must be in English**: source code, comments, commit messages, and documentation.
- **Human conversations in OpenCode remain in French**.

## Package Manager Policy

- Always use `pnpm` for installing, adding, and removing packages.
- Never use `npm` or `yarn`.

## Code Quality

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting:
- `pnpm lint` — check for code issues
- `pnpm format` — auto-format code
- `pnpm check` — run both (format + lint + organize imports)

Configuration: `biome.jsonc`

## Database

This project uses **PostgreSQL** as its database, accessed directly with raw SQL — **no ORM**.

SQL queries are executed using the [`postgres`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) library (package name: `postgres`).

Migrations are managed by [`postgres-shift`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres-shift) and located in `sqls/migrations/`.

The complete schema (consolidated) is written by hand in `sqls/schema.sql`.

## Example / Scaffolding Files

The following files are examples meant to be replaced with your actual project code:

- `sqls/migrations/00001_initial/` — example migration (creates a sample `contacts` table)
- `sqls/fixtures/00001_contacts.sql` — example fixture data
- `sqls/schema.sql` — example consolidated schema
- `src/hello_world.js` — example script demonstrating database access
- `README.md` — update the example output in the Getting Started section when replacing `src/hello_world.js`

These files are marked with comments (`-- Example` / `// Example`) at the top. Replace or remove them as needed.

> **Remove this entire section once the example files have been replaced or deleted.**



## Documentation Maintenance

Remove from this file any section or reference that becomes obsolete after file deletions or structural changes. Keep AGENTS.md up to date.
