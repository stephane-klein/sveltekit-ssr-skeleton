# ADR 001 — Internationalization with Paraglide JS

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-07-15
**Context**: [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/9618) on SvelteKit i18n best practices

## Context

This project needed internationalization with English and French. The application
is a non-content web app (dashboard, admin panel), not a content-heavy site.

## Decision Drivers

- No URL prefix for locales (no SEO benefit for a non-content app)
- Users can be anonymous (no account) but should still be able to switch language
- Authenticated users have a persistent locale preference stored in the database
- Locale must be immediately reflected on the current page after switching
- SSR must render in the correct locale

## Considered Options

### 1. URL prefix strategy (`/fr/dashboard`, `/en/dashboard`)

- **Pros**: SEO-friendly, shareable URLs, Paraglide-native
- **Cons**: Overhead for a dashboard app, URL pollution, conflicts with API route groups

### 2. Cookie-based with Paraglide's native cookie strategy (`strategy: ["cookie", "baseLocale"]`)

- **Pros**: Simple setup
- **Cons**: SvelteKit's `cookies.set()` defaults to `httpOnly: true`, making cookies
  invisible to JavaScript. Paraglide's `setLocale()` uses `document.cookie` which is
  silently dropped when a `httpOnly` cookie with the same name exists on the domain.

### 3. Query parameter (`?lang=fr`) + redirect

- **Pros**: Works around the httpOnly restriction
- **Cons**: Parameters visible in URL, double redirect, pollutes browser history

### 4. `["baseLocale"]` + custom cookie + AsyncLocalStorage nesting (chosen)

- **Pros**: Clean URLs, single cookie, immediate locale switch, no race condition
- **Cons**: Requires understanding of AsyncLocalStorage internals

## Decision

Use Paraglide JS with `["baseLocale"]` strategy. A single `locale` cookie is managed
manually outside Paraglide. The server-side locale is overridden via nesting a second
`serverAsyncLocalStorage.run()` call inside the Paraglide middleware callback.

On the client, a `Locale` class wraps `overwriteGetLocale`/`overwriteSetLocale` to
manage the reactive locale state. The initial locale is read from the `<html lang>`
attribute (set by the server via `transformPageChunk`).

All cookies set server-side explicitly pass `httpOnly: false` to remain accessible
from JavaScript.

## Consequences

- Positive: No URL prefix, no query parameters, single cookie
- Positive: AsyncLocalStorage nesting provides per-request safety with no race condition
- Neutral: The `locale` cookie is readable from JavaScript (acceptable for a non-sensitive preference)
- Neutral: Email templates are in YAML files outside Paraglide's message system
- Maintenance: Any new cookie set server-side that needs JS access must include `httpOnly: false`
